/* 
QUESTION:
Which states contribute the most to our profitability, and how can we
focus on the top 30% to maximize sales, orders, and resource allocation?
      */
	  
/*
QUESTION OVERVIEW - 
1. Business Challenge:
The company operates across multiple states, but profitability varies significantly. Some states 
outperform others in terms of profit, order volume, and sales, while others lag behind.

2. Objective of the Question:
This project aims to identify the top 30% of the most profitable states based on profit
contribution, sales volume, and order frequency. The insights derived will help optimize marketing
efforts, resource allocation, and sales strategies to maximize profitability in
high-performing states while enhancing performance in underperforming regions.

3. Analytical Approach:
•	Write SQL queries to analyze the top 30% of the most profitable states based on performance trends.
•   Rank states based on profit contribution, sales, order frequency, average discount (in %), and profit margin (in %).
•   Provide actionable recommendations for resource allocation and strategy optimization.
