---               5. Regional Performance
---- (Identifying key states driving profitability annually)

/* QUESTION:
Which three states consistently generate the highest profits year over year, and how can we focus
our resources and marketing efforts on these high-performing regions for sustainable growth?
     */

/*
QUESTION OVERVIEW - 
1. Business Challenge:
The company has observed significant performance variations across 
different states but lacks a structured approach to identifying 
top-performing regions. Despite evenly distributed resources, there 
is no clear visibility into which states consistently drive the highest profits.

2. Objective of the Question:
This question aims to identify the top 3 most profitable states each year,
enabling the business to optimize regional strategies, adjust inventory,
fine-tune pricing, and improve marketing efforts to maximize profitability.

3. Analytical Approach:
•	Write SQL queries to analyze year-over-year profitability trends by state.
•	Identify top-performing regions based on sales, profit, order volume , average discount (in %), and profit_margin (in %).
•	Provide data-driven recommendations to refine marketing, inventory allocation, and regional business strategies.

INSIGHTS & TRENDS
1.  Consistently High-Performing States:
•   New York and California have consistently ranked in the top 2 in profitability every year (2020-2023).
•   Washington also appears frequently but with slightly lower total profits than New York and California.

2.  New York Leads in Profit Margins:
•   New York's profit margin has grown from 21.22% in 2020 to 25.93% in 2023, indicating strong pricing power and profitability growth.
•   Washington has high profit margins (26.33% in 2023) but lower total sales, meaning it has strong profitability per unit but lower market penetration.

3.  California Dominates Sales but Not Margins:
•   California has the highest total sales volume each year, reaching $147.36K in 2023.
•   However, its profit margins remain relatively lower (~14-20%), suggesting a focus on high sales volume but lower profit efficiency.

4.  Indiana’s Surprising Profitability Spike in 2022:
•   Indiana had an exceptionally high profit margin (40.79%) in 2022, despite lower sales and order volume.
•   This suggests high-margin products were sold in Indiana that year, but it did not continue into 2023.

5.  Discounting Strategies and Their Impact:
•   New York keeps discounts low (~5-6%) while increasing profitability.
•   California applies higher discounts (~7-8%) but still maintains the highest sales volume.
