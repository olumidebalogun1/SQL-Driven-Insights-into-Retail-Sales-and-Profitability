/* 
QUESTION:
Which product subcategories across different categories contribute the most to our profitability,
and how can we focus on the top 30% to optimize sales and resource allocation?
      */
	  
/*
QUESTION OVERVIEW - 
1. Business Challenge:
The company is experiencing profitability challenges due to fluctuating sales and high market competition.
Despite offering a broad range of products, only a subset of sub-categories significantly contributes to
overall profitability, while others underperform or fail to generate enough revenue.

2. Objective of the Question:
This project aims to identify the top 30% most profitable product sub-categories based on profit contribution, 
sales volume, and margin. The insights derived will help optimize resource allocation, product offerings, and sales strategies
for maximum profitability. Additionally, it will improve inventory planning, marketing focus, and overall business
efficiency by prioritizing high-performing sub-categories.

3. Analytical Approach:
•	Write SQL queries to analyze the top 30% of the most profitable sub-categories based on performance trends.
•   Rank product sub-categories based on profit contribution, sales, order frequency, average discount (in %), and profit margin (in %).
•   Provide actionable recommendations for resource allocation and strategy optimization.
