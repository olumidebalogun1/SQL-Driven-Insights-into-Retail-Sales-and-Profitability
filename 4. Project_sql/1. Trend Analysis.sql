/* QUESTION:
How has the company’s annual sales, profit, and order quantity evolved over time,
   and what trends indicate potential growth or decline? 
   */

/*
QUESTION OVERVIEW - 
1. Business Challenge:
The company wants to assess its financial health and long-term growth trajectory.
While sales and profits may be increasing, leadership seeks deeper insights into
whether this growth is accelerating, stagnating, or declining.

2. Objective of the Question:
This question aims to analyze year-over-year (YoY) trends in sales, profit, 
and order quantity to identify potential growth opportunities and warning signs of decline,
thereby helping the business refine pricing strategies, optimize sales efforts, 
and improve operational efficiency for sustained profitability.

3. Analytical Approach:
•	Write SQL queries to calculate YoY percentage changes in key business metrics.
•	Identify high-performing years and warning signs of decline.
•	Provide data-driven recommendations to sustain business growth.

INSIGHTS & TRENDS
I. Positive Trends:
1. Sales Recovery & Growth: After a dip in 2021 (-2.79%), sales rebounded strongly in 2022 (+29.30%) and continued growing in 2023 (+20.25%).
2. Profit Surge: Profit grew steadily each year, with the most significant jump in 2022 (+32.35%).
3. Order Quantity Growth: Increased every year, peaking in 2023 with a +26.96% boost.

II. Potential Concerns:
1. Sales Decline in 2021 (-2.79%): The dip in revenue indicates external challenges or strategy misalignment.
2. Slower Profit Growth in 2023 (14.05% vs. 32.35% in 2022): Growth is positive but decelerating, which may suggest increasing costs or competitive pricing pressures.
3. Order Growth > Profit Growth: The number of units sold is growing faster than profit in 2023, signaling possible margin compression or pricing inefficiencies.
